# 10 Days of Code-Austin: Web Scraping in Python
Web scraping using Python by scrape data from a static web page using the requests and Beautiful Soup libraries, export that data into a structured text file using the pandas library. This is part of Data School tutorial and I added a bar graph using seaborn for presentation. Thank you Data School and my mentor Gregory Godreau.
