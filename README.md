# 10 Days of Code-Austin (Feb 17, 2018): Web Scraping in Python
Web scraping using Python by scrape data from a static web page(The New York Times) using the requests and Beautiful Soup libraries, export that data into a structured text file using the pandas library. This is part of Data School tutorial and I added a bar graph using seaborn for data visualization. Thank you Data School and my mentor Gregory Godreau.
