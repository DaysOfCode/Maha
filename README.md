# Web Scraping
Web scraping using Python by scrape data from a static web page using the requests and Beautiful Soup libraries, export that data into a structured text file using the pandas library. This is part of Data School tutorial but I added graph using seaborn for better presentation. Thank you Data School and my mentor Gregory Godreau.
